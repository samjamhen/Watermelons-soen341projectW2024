- Users can choose their preferred vehicle from the catalog, specifying pickup address and time.
- Prompted to either log in or create a new account to proceed with the reservation.

**2. Reservation Completion:**
- After selecting a vehicle, users are guided through the reservation process.
- Collect user information and ask for login or account creation.
Request pickup address, time, and vehicle details.

**3. Payment Process:**
- Upon completing the reservation, users are prompted for credit card information.
- Payment policies, such as partial payment or full payment, are to be determined.

**4. Confirmation:**
- Display completed reservations for users to review.
- Send email confirmations to users with reservation details.

**5. Modification and Cancellation:**
