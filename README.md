## Project Description
### Car Catalog (Database)
Our system revolves around a comprehensive car catalog database, encompassing various categories such as compact, standard, intermediate, etc. Key attributes include:

- Category (e.g., compact, standard, intermediate)
- Type (Car, Van, SUV, etc)
- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Price

### Reservation System
**1. Selection Process:**
- Users can choose their preferred vehicle from the catalog, specifying pickup address and time.
- Prompted to either log in or create a new account to proceed with the reservation.

**2. Reservation Completion:**
- After selecting a vehicle, users are guided through the reservation process.
- Collect user information and ask for login or account creation.
Request pickup address, time, and vehicle details.

**3. Payment Process:**
- Upon completing the reservation, users are prompted for credit card information.
- Payment policies, such as partial payment or full payment, are to be determined.

**4. Confirmation:**
- Display completed reservations for users to review.
- Send email confirmations to users with reservation details.

**5. Modification and Cancellation:**
- Implement policies for modifying or canceling reservations (details to be determined).

**6. Feedback System:**
- Allow users to add comments and ratings for the rented vehicles.
